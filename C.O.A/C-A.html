                <br><span class="answer">Pipelining is dividing a task into separate stages, with each stage handled by a different processor segment, so multiple instructions can be in progress at the same time.</span></li>
            <li><span class="question">2. How does instruction pipelining increase CPU performance?</span>
                <br><span class="answer">It overlaps the execution of multiple instructions, so a new instruction can start before the previous one finishes, increasing throughput.</span></li>

                <br><span class="answer">Data hazards (data dependencies), control hazards (branches/jumps), and structural hazards (hardware resource conflicts).</span></li>
            <li><span class="question">4. What is a data hazard? Give one example.</span>
                <br><span class="answer">A data hazard occurs when instructions depend on the results of previous instructions. Example: If instruction 2 needs the result of instruction 1, but instruction 1 hasn't finished yet.</span></li>
            <li><span class="question">5. What is a multiprocessor system?</span>
                <br><span class="answer">A computer system with two or more CPUs working together, sharing memory and I/O, to run multiple tasks or split one job into several parts.</span></li>
            <li><span class="question">6. What is the difference between UMA and NUMA memory organizations?</span>
                <br><span class="answer">UMA (Uniform Memory Access): All CPUs access memory with the same speed. NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access): Each CPU has local memory (faster) and remote memory (slower to access).</span></li>
            <li><span class="question">7. Name two common interconnection network topologies in multiprocessors.</span>
                <br><span class="answer">Bus (all CPUs share a single path) and Mesh (CPUs arranged in a grid, each connected to neighbors).</span></li>
            <li><span class="question">8. What is cache coherence and why is it important?</span>
                <br><span class="answer">Cache coherence means all CPUs have the latest, correct version of shared data in their caches. It's important to avoid errors when different CPUs work on the same memory locations.</span></li>
            <li><span class="question">9. Briefly explain the write-through and write-back cache protocols.</span>
                <br><span class="answer">Write-through: Data is written to both cache and main memory immediately. Write-back: Data is written to cache first, and main memory is updated later.</span></li>
            <li><span class="question">10. What is a snoopy cache protocol?</span>
                <br><span class="answer">A method where each cache monitors (snoops) the bus to track changes made by other CPUs, keeping cache data coherent in small/bus-based multiprocessor systems.</span></li>
